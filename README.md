# Intro to Quantum Software Development

These are the source files for the labs / exercises used in MITRE's Intro to Quantum Software development course. 
Each lab corresponds with a module or section in the course guides and covers a specific topic.

The labs are built as unit tests with both Q# and Qiskit; students must "complete the puzzle" by implementing the missing body of the test.
In each lab, the problems start simple and progressively get harder so the student can demonstrate mastery of the entire lesson at hand.

Solutions are available upon request.
Please contact the MITRE Quantum Software team for more information.

These labs are intended to be used with the following environment:

- [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)
- [.NET Core SDK 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/visual-studio-sdks) (because QDK doesn't support .NET 5+ yet)
- [Microsoft Quantum Development Kit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quantum.DevKit)
- Python 3.8+
- [Qiskit](https://pypi.org/project/qiskit/) v0.27.0+
